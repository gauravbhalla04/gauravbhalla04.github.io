                This is a page for all my projects, it includes a brief documentation about the project.
                I hope you find this interesting, and are able to get something useful from this page.

            </p>

            <p>

                As of 28/3/2020, all my projects on this website are made in JavaScript using the p5js library,
                this is because these are the most easily shared projects due to their compatibility with websites.
                <del>I'm working on a solution to display my other projects in python - the other main language that I
                work with.<del>

        <p class="title"> Snake </p>

        <img class="projectHeader" src="images/snake.png" style="width: 100vw">
        <div style="padding-right: 5%; padding-left: 5%;">
        <p>

            This project was one of my first, and I envisioned it being similar to the original snake that was on
            the old Nokia phones. The reason I chose to make a snake game as one of my first projects was to allow me to
            practice my skills in JavaScript on a problem I knew the rules and restraints to. It allowed me to focus
            my attention to solving the problem without having to define the problem. In the end, I believe it turned
            out better than I had imagined, with smooth movement and and a dark theme to it. In terms of further
            development, I'm currently in the process of learning how to generate Hamiltonian paths to allow the
            snake to be controlled be the computer (in a way that is slightly cheating, but who reads the fine print anyway?).
            I would also like to allow the mobile and tablet users to control the snake using swipes on the screen, rather
            than requiring an external keyboard.

        </p>

        <p>

            The actual development process I'd like to believe was fairly painless, however, that would be a lie. I can admit
            that I found it fairly difficult to keep track of the snake's individual sections, although the rest was fairly
            easy in comparison. I used object oriented programming to make it easy to scale the program, and used variables
            declared at the start and defined fairly early on instead of hard coding to allow me to easily make changes.
            For an explanation as to why I chose to use object oriented programming, you can read the post about object

        </p>
        <p>

            In the development process, the first step for me was to identify the different challenges I would face in
            making the project. I broke the problem down into these key fundamentals:
        </p>
        <p>
            - movement
        </p>
        <p>
            - snake collision with self/walls
        </p>

        <p>
            - snake collision with food

        </p>
        <p>
            - generating positions for food and displaying the food
        </p>
        <p>
            - keeping track of and displaying the previous snake positions

        </p>

        <p>


            I then began to systematically go through the steps of solving these problems in order. I began with implementing
            the snake movement. In this I chose to use arrow keys on an external keyboard as it seemed to be the most feasible
            option, and I later added support for the 'wasd' keys. This was fairly easy, and it laid out a lot of the ground work
            that I would later use to solve the rest of the problems.

        </p>
        <p>

            Moving onto the second problem, I realised I could not use a snake that was only one block to check for collision with self,
            and I had to first extend the snake, this forced me to first solve the problem of keeping track of and displaying the
            previous snake positions. I used a dynamic array (really a list as it's dynamic and can hold multiple types of date but JavaScript
            insists it's an array) to store the coordinates of the snake's sections, updating them every time the snake moved to move
            them all along one value. I then iterated over the array to make 'boxes' at the appropriate coordinates without a
            border to give the effect of the snake being one object. I was then ready to tackle the next problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order check for collision, I used a builtin function that would calculate the distance between two points, and when
            the distance was one pixel or less, I would assume a collision had occurred and declare the snake dead, restarting
            the game. I carried this on to the collision check with the food, passing a set of coordinates to the function and checking
            if the snake's head had collided with the food, representing it eating the food. This would then trigger a function that
            generated a new set of random coordinates and display the food at the new position. The game was complete, now I just
            needed to add some colour.

        </p>
        <p>

            In conclusion, I would say this was a fairly successful project as I not only completed the project, I also was able to
            challenge myself and expand upon my skillset.
