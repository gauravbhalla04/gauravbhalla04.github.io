                            This is a fairly short book, it’s seven chapters and about 130 pages. In that, however, it contains a large wealth of information and is densely packed
                            with unbiased insights into key questions that form the heart of political philosophy. In my opinion, it fulfils the purpose it sets out; give a very
                            short introduction to the world of political philosophy. It argues from both ends of the basic political spectrum and gives each ideology’s argument
                            the respect it deserves when being discussed. For someone who is just starting to get into politics and is looking for guidance on how each ideology 
                            differs as well as the key questions that each must strive to answer, I strongly recommend this book.

                    <p>

                            A feature of this book that I especially liked was that although the chapters were linked, it wasn’t integral to have read the previous chapter to read the next one; you could pick it up at any point. This makes it easy to read over a few weeks or even months if you are hard pressed for time. Even though I read it in one sitting, I know there are many people who don’t have that privilege and it’s one of the reasons they may be deterred from reading, but this book doesn’t pose that problem.

                    <p>

                            The integral part of the book is really the content, however, and although I touched upon it slightly in the introduction, I have yet to go into detail and provide a fuller insight into the book. I’ll begin with saying that the author does indeed provide a very short introduction that introduces readers to key aspects of political philosophy without being dragged down by technical terminology or losing a sense of the depth of the issues being discussed. It discusses why we need political philosophy, key arguments for and against political authority, the benefits of democracy and its downfalls - and how to overcome these. It then discusses freedom and how to define inviolable freedom versus that which can be sacrificed by the state for the good of wider society, providing arguments from both libertarian and authoritarian points of view, with the reader being left to draw their own conclusions on where the line between personal freedom and societal freedom is. The book then goes on to discuss justice, and its evolution between different circumstances, shedding light on how there is no theory that can be defined as perfect.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    The questions asked in earlier chapters are then given further dimension by the last two chapters; the first concerned with how modern society may tackle these questions, with the rise in feminist movements and the multicultural nations that we live in. The second discusses justice on a larger scale: a global scale. It presents the arguments from cosmopolitanism camp of thought who believe there should only be one overarching government or that all states enter a permanent agreement to work together and uphold the principles of justice globally. The author provides arguments against these views too, but not in a disproportionate manner; giving the reader the capacity to draw their own conclusions.

                    The one thing that I did find to hinder my ability to enjoy this book was the overly complex sentence structures; and I have been guilty of this myself in my writing. Although it was infrequent, I found myself losing track of the wider sense of the sentence. This wasn’t due to the use of obscure terminology, as I mentioned earlier the terminology was fairly accessible, but rather the use of sentences that spanned multiple lines using many connectives (although I see the irony in the fact that this is a multi-line sentence). My advice to readers would be to ensure you are in a miasma without distractions, allowing you to direct you focus to the book.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                Overall, I once again circle back to starting point: the book provides a clear and reliable introduction to political philosophy. As quoted on the back of the book, it is “Clearly written, widely accessible, comprehensive, and a reliable guide to important controversies…” (Lord Parekh).

                            Many programmers will be familiar with the term "Object Oriented Programming" (OOP), and many will know what this refers to. However, there are also plenty
                            of beginners implementing OOP unknowingly. OOP is key to modern languages and many modern programs are based on this idea, it gives the programmer
                            immense power and in the right hands can result in great things. A popular language among beginners is Python, a language that allows you to harness
                            the power of OOP in a clear and simple manner due to its syntax, in fact Python was one of my first programming languages. This post will outline
                            clearly what is OOP, its advantages and how to use it in your programs as well as applying the same concept to daily life.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            OOP, by definition is a program is structured around data and objects rather than functions. This means classes in Python are key to this as they
                            allow you to structure a program around that class and generate objects based on that class anytime. I define a class as a blueprint for an object,
                            Each object of that class has the same properties and can do the same things (can call the same functions). In JavaScript you use a function to
                            set out this blueprint and give it properties. With this it becomes much easier to make bigger, more complex programs, and this is evidenced by the
                            increase in complexity of apps on your phone and games on your computer or console. My favourite example is that of FPS games: because without OOP
                            it would not be possible for them to be so large, weapons are created according to one blueprint and then certain properties are adjusted
                            to make them unique. This allows for a much more immersive and customisable experience due to the large number of options available to the user.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            The advantages of OOP can easily be summarised in one statement, "it's better for bigger programs". But this doesn't really explain <i>why</i>. And
                            in my opinion if you don't know <i>why</i> something works or is better, you don't really know whether it truly does work or it truly is better. The
                            main reason for me why OOP is so important in my programs is that it makes everything <i>simpler</i>. Straight and simple. I can recreate multiple
                            objects of that type using a block of code I only have to write once. It makes keeping track of objects much easier and makes code cleaner as there
                            is minimal repeated code. It allows you to write code once, debug it and not have to worry about that part of the code again. It is the <i>soul</i>
                            of modular programming in my opinion. Modular programming is the way into the future, breaking a problem down into smaller chunks and finding
                            solutions to smaller problems in order to solve a larger problem.  This makes debugging and future maintenance much easier, as well as allowing
                            other people to more easily join in and become integrated in the development process.
