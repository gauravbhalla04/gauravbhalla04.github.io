                            Many programmers will be familiar with the term "Object Oriented Programming" (OOP), and many will know what this refers to. However, there are also plenty 
                            of beginners implementing OOP unknowingly. OOP is key to modern languages and many modern programs are based on this idea, it gives the programmer
                            immense power and in the right hands can result in great things. A popular language among beginners is Python, a language that allows you to harness
                            the power of OOP in a clear and simple manner due to its syntax, in fact Python was one of my first programming languages. This post will outline 
                            clearly what is OOP, its advantages and how to use it in your programs as well as applying the same concept to daily life.
                            
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            
                            OOP, by definition is a program is structured around data and objects rather than functions. This means classes in Python are key to this as they 
                            allow you to structure a program around that class and generate objects based on that class anytime. I define a class as a blueprint for an object,
                            Each object of that class has the same properties and can do the same things (can call the same functions). In JavaScript you use a function to 
                            set out this blueprint and give it properties. With this it becomes much easier to make bigger, more complex programs, and this is evidenced by the 
                            increase in complexity of apps on your phone and games on your computer or console. My favourite example is that of FPS games: because without OOP
                            it would not be possible for them to be so large, weapons are created according to one blueprint and then certain properties are adjusted
                            to make them unique. This allows for a much more immersive and customisable experience due to the large number of options available to the user.

                        <br>

                            The advantages of OOP can easily be summarised in one statement, "it's better for bigger programs". But this doesn't really explain <i>why</i>. And 
                            in my opinion if you don't know <i>why</i> something works or is better, you don't really know whether it truly does work or it truly is better. The
                            main reason for me why OOP is so important in my programs is that it makes everything <i>simpler</i>. Straight and simple. I can recreate multiple
                            objects of that type using a block of code I only have to write once. It makes keeping track of objects much easier and makes code cleaner as there
                            is minimal repeated code. It allows you to write code once, debug it and not have to worry about that part of the code again. It is the <i>soul</i>
                            of modular programming in my opinion. Modular programming is the way into the future, breaking a problem down into smaller chunks and finding 
                            solutions to smaller problems in order to solve a larger problem.  This makes debugging and future maintenance much easier, as well as allowing
                            other people to more easily join in and become integrated in the development process.
