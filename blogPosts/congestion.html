         <p>
           Congestion is an issue that affects many cities and towns in first
           world countries. A prime example, and the one I will focus on today,
           is London. London, like many other major cities, is a sprawling,
           densely populated area which is still constantly attracting more
           people due to the benefits of agglomeration (I will discuss
           agglomeration in another article in the future). This led to increased
           pressure on the transport network in London and eventually led to the
           traffic volume (cars per mile) exceeding the maximum capacity. What
           can be done to resolve the issue? Build more roads? Introduce a
           congestion tax? Limit the extent to which cities are allowed to expand
           and thereby limit the number of people in the area?
         </p>

         <p>
           First, I want to discuss congestion itself and define it. In an area,
           congestion is when the traffic volume is higher than the maximum
           capacity. This essentially means the network is overloaded and traffic
           moves slower than it usually would, and this leads to more volume and
           so the traffic slows further.
         </p>

         <p>
           Flow is another important term, which is speed multiplied by the
           travel time. From this we can see there are two measures of
           congestion: the speed cars are travelling at the travel time in
           comparison to the speed of cars travel at free-flow (when the network
           isn't overwhelmed) or the time it takes at free-flow. Both are
           essentially the same thing but expressed in two different ways. If the
           speed at free-flow is 30mph but cars are travelling at 28mph, then
           congestion is likely not the issue, but if they're travelling at 15mph
           then that would be congestion. And similarly, if a journey usually
           takes 40 minutes at free-flow but you take 45 minutes then it is
           likely not congestion, but if it takes you an hour then it is likely
           congestion. Now that we've established how we determine whether
           congestion is an issue, we can move onto discussing what causes
           congestion.
         </p>

         <p>
           Congestion is caused by too many people trying to travel on the same
           network at the same time. In economic terms, we could rephrase this as
           the demand for travel exceeding the supply for travel. But what is the
           demand for travel? Do people take a bus to school because they enjoy
           the bus ride? Do people drive to work because they enjoy being stuck
           in traffic? No, of course not. People travel because it provides
           access to opportunities, whether that be education or employment or
           something else is irrelevant, people travel to access opportunity.
           This means that the demand for travel is derived from the demand for
           the opportunities offered by travel.
         </p>

         <p>
           Moving onto looking at the issue from the supply side, we can view
           congestion as being the result of a market equilibrating process, and
           so increasing the supply of transport changes the equilibrium but it
           doesn't decrease congestion. This is because with increased supply,
           say perhaps a new high-speed train line, all that happens is more
           people travel and people travel further. But then why do policymakers
           continue to make new roads? It's not to reduce congestion, it's
           instead to change the equilibrium. Say a new road allows an extra 1000
           people to reach a very productive area that allows more people to
           experience the benefits of agglomeration, that's still beneficial for
           the economy but it isn't necessarily the most effective way to reduce
           congestion. This is the law of peak hour expressway congestion (Downs
           1962) which says that the peak hour congestion in urban areas rises to
           meet maximum capacity. Furthermore, by increasing supply you allow
           more people to access opportunities in an area, and so the demand
           increases, therefore the demand is induced as well.
         </p>

         <p>
           But if increasing the supply of transport doesn't help with
           congestion, then why do governments continue to invest so much money
           into infrastructure? It’s because it leads to more people being able
           to access the benefits from agglomeration in big cities. Thus we see a
           repeating loop, as land becomes more accessible due to better
           transport links, it becomes more developed, more people live there,
           more transport is developed there to serve their needs and this
           repeats. We could perhaps use it to explain the North/South divide in
           England; what started as a small gap due to a declining manufacturing
           sector and developing tertiary sector is now a massive gap, caused by
           the cumulative causation in terms of infrastructure development.
         </p>

         <p>
           So what can be done to resolve the issue of congestion if not
           increasing the supply of transport? One approach is to limit the
           extent to which cities can expand. This would essentially limit the
           number of people crammed into a small area and therefore limit the
           number of people willing and able to use the transport, thus limiting
           demand and thereby reducing congestion. However, the drawback of this
           is that it limits the number of people that can access the
           agglomeration benefits of the city. This can hinder economic growth in
           that region and for the economy as a whole, as well as reducing the
           earning potential of the people unable to access the city and thus
           leading to a fall in their standard of living.
         </p>

         <p>
           Another possible approach is to introduce a congestion tax, as was
           done in London. This increases the cost of travelling via chargeable
           modes of transport and so at every given time and price, without
           accounting for the congestion charge, fewer people are willing and
           able to travel due to the congestion charge. This leads to a reduction
           in congestion. In London where there is a congestion charge, this has
           been very effective. However, a major flaw of it is that it is a
           regressive tax, it is a higher proportion of income for those earning
           less than those earning more since it is the same for all people. This
           leads to a rise in inequality, which is undesirable.
         </p>

         <p>
           In a future article, I would also like to discuss the effect of
           different economic structures of cities on congestion, and if the
           approaches discussed in this article have different results and
           perhaps look at different approaches more suited to those structures.
