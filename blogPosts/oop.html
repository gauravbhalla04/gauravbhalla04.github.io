  Many programmers will be familiar with the term "Object Oriented Programming"
  (OOP), and many will know what this refers to. However, there are also plenty
  of beginners implementing OOP unknowingly. OOP is key to modern languages and
  many modern programs are based on this idea, it gives the programmer immense
  power and in the right hands can result in great things. A popular language
  among beginners is Python, a language that allows you to harness the power of
  OOP in a clear and simple manner due to its syntax, in fact Python was one of
  my first programming languages. This post will outline clearly what is OOP,
  its advantages and how to use it in your programs as well as applying the same
  concept to daily life.
</p>

<p>
  OOP, by definition is a program is structured around data and objects rather
  than functions. This means classes in Python are key to this as they allow you
  to structure a program around that class and generate objects based on that
  class anytime. I define a class as a blueprint for an object, Each object of
  that class has the same properties and can do the same things (can call the
  same functions). In JavaScript you use a function to set out this blueprint
  and give it properties. With this it becomes much easier to make bigger, more
  complex programs, and this is evidenced by the increase in complexity of apps
  on your phone and games on your computer or console. My favourite example is
  that of FPS games: because without OOP it would not be possible for them to be
  so large, weapons are created according to one blueprint and then certain
  properties are adjusted to make them unique. This allows for a much more
  immersive and customisable experience due to the large number of options
  available to the user.
</p>

<p>
  The advantages of OOP can easily be summarised in one statement, "it's better
  for bigger programs". But this doesn't really explain <i>why</i>. And in my
  opinion if you don't know <i>why</i> something works or is better, you don't
  really know whether it truly does work or it truly is better. The main reason
  for me why OOP is so important in my programs is that it makes everything
  <i>simpler</i>. Straight and simple. I can recreate multiple objects of that
  type using a block of code I only have to write once. It makes keeping track
  of objects much easier and makes code cleaner as there is minimal repeated
  code. It allows you to write code once, debug it and not have to worry about
  that part of the code again. It is the <i>soul</i>
  of modular programming in my opinion. Modular programming is the way into the
  future, breaking a problem down into smaller chunks and finding solutions to
  smaller problems in order to solve a larger problem. This makes debugging and
  future maintenance much easier, as well as allowing other people to more
  easily join in and become integrated in the development process.
