                            The Ship of Theseus is a famous philosophical paradox, one that’s very important to consider. A short summary is this: if you start 
                    with a ship, and gradually replace each plank with a new plank due to repairs and make a ship out of the discarded planks - which is the 
                    original ship? Questions about identity stem from this, on a surface level: “What makes the original ship, the original ship and gives it its
                    identity?” which is extrapolatable to “What makes you, you? Are you the same person throughout all of time? What gives anything its identity?”
             

                        </p>
                        <br>
                
                <p>
                    While discussions of identity are great, to go straight there would be going to a steppingstone in the <em>middle</em> of the river. We must first look 
                    at proposed solutions to the Ship of Theseus question as intermediaries. The first solution I will discuss is based on the four causes defined 
                    by Greek philosopher Aristotle.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    Aristotle defines four causes: the material cause, referring to what something is made of; the formal cause, referring to its defining features;
                    the efficient cause, referring to how it was made; and the final cause, referring to its function. And if an object’s causes remain unchanged,
                    it is the same object as before, thus its identity remains unchanged.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    Let’s assume that the ship we started with and gradually repaired is ship A, and the ship that was constructed by collecting the discarded planks 
                    is ship B.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    The final cause of Ship A is the same as the original ship, and Ship B’s final cause isn’t the same because the condition of its planks prevents it 
                    from perhaps even floating, never mind sailing. This applies only to Ship A and provides a clear answer to the question: Ship A is the original ship.
                    However, there is more than one way to accomplish the same function. Imagine two knives, both of which perform the same function and thereby have the 
                    same final cause but are different objects. Furthermore, if the function of a ship is to allow sea travel, then there is more than one way to accomplish 
                    that. A ship and a raft are not the same but have the same final cause. This is a fault caused by lack of detail, the cause is too vague to allow us to 
                    identify objects.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    The efficient cause of Ship A is the same as the original ship’s: the planks are cut by the same people using the same tools and techniques. However,
                    we know the planks of Ship B are made by the same people using the same tools as the original ship. This cause applies to both ships and doesn’t
                    distinguish between the two ships. This cause too has a fundamental flaw: a person can use the same tools and techniques to make two different objects.
                    For example, a carpenter can use the same tools and resources to make a chair and a table, yet these two aren’t the same.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    Additionally, neither ship satisfies all four causes, only three each. To decide between these, are we to try and figure out which one fulfils the more
                    important causes? How do we decide which causes are more important? Do we just accept that there are two originals? There seems to be no basis to justify
                    doing such a thing, so this approach doesn’t provide an answer to the question.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    After having considered this approach, one might argue that it fails to provide an answer to the question so has no implications on identity. However, 
                    perhaps the failure of an object’s causes to identify it suggests that identity is decided by others, and nobody has their own identity. It is merely an 
                    idea that every person associates with others, and inconsistent.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    Another approach is to first simplify the question. What makes the original ship, the original ship? We can arguably say that the answer to this is the 
                    same as the answer to this question: “What makes you, you?” How do we identify others? When conversing with them through an anonymous messaging app without 
                    seeing them, it would be their thoughts, the way perhaps they use certain phrases or words. What leads to the development of these characteristics? Building 
                    on this, we can answer the question “What makes you, you?”
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                
                <p>
                    It’s your experiences, because it is by experience that humans learn certain thought processes and other things. You are therefore the same person from
                    5 years ago but with more experience. Your identity remains the same, but it refers to a more experienced person, perhaps like a ship with an added sail. 
                    Thus, we come to the conclusion that it is your experiences that give you your identity. 
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    Drawing on the previous paragraph, the experiences of the ship should be used to identify which is the original ship, as that is what makes the original 
                    ship, the original ship. Therefore, we just need to answer the question: “Which ship has more of the original’s experiences?” As the experiences of the 
                    original ship are in the planks that make Ship B, the original is Ship B. Thus, we seem to have a conclusion. There are, however, faults in this argument
                    too. If, after one plank is replaced, Ship A is still the original ship, then are the new plank’s experiences part of the original ship’s experiences, and
                    so on for the second and further planks which are replaced? If so, that would mean that the original ship’s experiences are in both the sets of planks. If 
                    not, then we don’t have an original ship while we wait for each plank to be replaced. How do we then decide which is the original ship? The ship which is
                    made up of the planks that were in the “original” ship for longer? Well, if we wait long enough between replacing planks, then the planks in Ship A make
                    up more experience, otherwise the planks in Ship B have more experience. If we knew the exact time period for which each plank was part of the original ship,
                    then we could calculate which ship was the original, overcoming this hurdle. However, this theory fails to answer the question qualitatively, providing 
                    instead a mathematical equation.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                     Regardless, there is another fault: wooden planks aren’t alive to experience things. They are inanimate objects, and so don’t have a consciousness to
                    experience things and give them identity. The implications of this challenge on the concept of identity are severe: suggesting inanimate objects are all the
                    same and have no identity. 
                    
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    The implications on identity from this approach are similar to those from the previous approach, except in one key aspect. Identity is still linked to ideas, 
                    but it is not an idea that the identifier associates with the person being identified. Instead, it is the ideas and experiences of the person being identified 
                    that are interpreted, and while everybody may interpret them in different ways, the same fundamental idea remains. This means identity is innate, and that it
                    grows with the person. However, our cells change over time, they die and are replaced by new ones - even in the brain where you process your experiences. A 
                    potential challenge arising from this would be to consider whether or not this affects our perception of identity as being founded on the ideas of the person 
                    being identified if the cells processing experiences change. Does this mean your identity changes as you get older? Are you really the same person throughout 
                    your life if your identity has changed?
                    
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the implications of the Ship of Theseus are that it raises doubts on the concept of identity, whether people actually have an innate identity 
                    or if it’s all a matter of subjective ideas. Further exploration of the question led to a line of thought that differs in one crucial way. It countered the 
                    original doubts about identity, highlighting instead that people do indeed have an innate identity and while we may all interpret this differently, it is still
                    the same identity.
