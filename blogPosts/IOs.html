        <div class="text">
          <p>
            There are many international organisations (IOs) in the modern
            world, some are focused on peacekeeping such as the UN, others have
            a more economic purpose such as the IMF, WTO and World Bank. Others
            contribute towards global health, such as the WHO. Do they achieve
            this though? Or are member states’ only members to get some other
            gain from IOs? There are three different ideas that I want to
            discuss: constructivism, neo-liberalism and neo-realism, and which
            of the three I'm inclined towards.
          </p>

          <p>
            When discussing IOs, constructivists argue that the role of IOs is
            to regulate and modify the identity and interests of states. This is
            to allow economic prosperity, political stability and peace to be
            maintained globally. In essence, everything I discuss today will be
            about what IOs can do to allow economic prosperity, political
            stability and peace to be maintained globally. If IOs modify the
            identity and interests of member states so they can better cooperate
            on political issues, economic issues and humanitarian issues then
            they would be achieving their aim.
          </p>

          <p>
            Neo-liberalists argue that the role of IOs is to promote cooperation
            and stability, as that leads to the three things mentioned earlier.
            This is because cooperation allows countries to work together for a
            common goal, and the result of countries working together is greater
            than the sum of its parts (I will discuss this in another article in
            the future). Stability allows an environment in which countries can
            invest freely in infrastructure and education among other services,
            without the fear of conflict leading them to save more for defence
            than they would otherwise. This is not only beneficial for developed
            economies, but also for developing economies as they benefit greatly
            from even minor improvements in infrastructure etc. This can help to
            accelerate their growth and lead to the level of global inequality
            decreasing at a much greater rate than otherwise possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we should discuss the argument from neo-realists, and that
            is that IOs are a product of state interest and so cannot
            independently function. This is a somewhat opposite stance to the
            neo-liberalists, in that neo-liberalists say IOs modify the
            interests of states but neo-realists argue that state interests
            govern IOs. To develop this argument further, IOs are a product of
            state interest and so they are there to provide value to the member
            states which have more influence in them, naturally western
            countries due to their greater political and economic power. This
            essentially turns them into tools for those countries to achieve
            what they want. An example is the IMF, when giving money to
            developing countries there are stringent conditions placed upon the
            use of the money which forces those countries into abiding by rules
            set by economists who don't know anything about the true situation
            of the country. This has disastrous consequences, which can lead to
            the demise of a developing country that was developing well until
            they were forced to adjust their trade barriers to suit western
            countries rather than their economic situation. One might argue that
            IOs are just a tool of western countries for modern 'colonialism' by
            forcing their economic ideals upon developing countries when they
            aren't suited to the economies' needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you may have guessed from the last paragraph, I am ever so
            slightly inclined towards neo-realism. The other argument that I
            might be inclined towards is the neo-liberalistic argument, however,
            I will explain now why I believe the neo-realistic argument is the
            most convincing when thinking about the modern world. In an ideal
            world, I might argue that the role of IOs would be to promote
            cooperation and stability as neo-liberalists argue, but I feel the
            constructivist argument doesn't represent the role of an IO, but
            rather a global government that then gives power to nations'
            governments, similar to a federal governing system.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm going to be making the case for the neo-realistic argument based
            on the IMF and the World Bank's approach towards providing aid to
            developing countries. During the 1980s and 1990s, the advice given
            to these countries was based upon the Washington Consensus - even
            the name implying American control. And this wasn't tailored to
            individual countries' situations, but rather forced upon them in
            exchange for money. Countries were being forced to exchange their
            sovereignty for money, and oftentimes the trade wasn't worth it
            because no matter how much money is available if it isn't
            accompanied by the correct policies there won't be any progress.
            Furthermore, the lesson wasn't learned by the IOs, with many
            countries being forced to exchange their sovereignty for money.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than providing countries with the support and information to
            make an informed choice about the policies they would adopt, the IMF
            and World Bank continued to force the same strategy on every
            country. Countries should have been allowed to consider
            alternatives, and through democratic processes been allowed to
            choose one that best suited their economic situation. Instead, what
            happened was that the IMF and World Bank, conveniently headed by a
            British and American economist respectively, forced Western economic
            ideals of on countries at a pace for which they weren't ready and
            this led to nascent economies being shut down. While I don't fully
            agree that IOs are a tool for Western powers to engage in modern
            colonialism, it's hard to say the argument is completely false.
          </p>

          <p>
            What causes IOs to be vulnerable to manipulation by Western powers
            though? It's because they have no reason to contribute large sums of
            money if they aren't getting something back in return, and that's
            influence over the IO's decisions and actions. In the IMF, due to
            its large voting power, the USA has a unique veto power, which
            allows them to control the IMF's decisions as they wish.
            Furthermore, the UN has 5 permanent countries in the security
            council with veto powers, and again this goes against the
            fundamental of democracy that each member has equal representation.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is caused by each state's interests, countries such as America
            spend are member states in exchange for power and developing
            countries are member states for the aid provided. It seems to be
            somewhat like a corporation, you give more resources (such as
            America) in exchange for greater influence over the organisation's
            decisions. It leads to IOs being driven by specific state interests,
            and thus they can't independently function.
          </p>

          <p>
            This entire discussion leaves me with a peculiar thought: would
            developing countries be better off forming organisations to help
            each other without the developed powers exchanging 'aid' for control
            over developing countries?
