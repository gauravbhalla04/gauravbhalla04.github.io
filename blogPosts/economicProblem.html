            TIn the short term, there is an infinite number of problems facing the modern world. The most obvious of these is the recession from the coronavirus pandemic which has affected the entire global economy. However, these are all problems that have a solution, even if that happens to be extremely long term. One problem however that doesn't seem to have a solution is that of slowing economic growth in service sector economies. This essay will discuss a potential cause and solutions to this problem, which is the world’s largest economic challenge faced today because of the significance of economic growth in increasing the average standard of living.
          </p>

          <p>
            The force which drives economic growth in an economy is a rise in aggregate demand or aggregate supply, as both lead to a rise in the real GDP of an economy. To raise aggregate demand, a government must raise one of the four things: consumption in the economy, government expenditure, investments or the difference between exports and imports (X - M). Raising aggregate supply requires long term investment in education, infrastructure and other sectors which increase the "quality" of the workforce. However, both are limited in terms of how much they can rise in an economy, and that is limit is decided by the population of an economy, or rather the size of the workforce in an economy. This means that while an economy can continue growing while the population remains stable, over time the economy will reach the limit which can be supported, and the economy stagnates. A stagnated economy leads to a stagnation in the standards of living for those in the economy - exemplified by the economy size and standard of living staying essentially the same throughout the entire Middle Ages until the scientific/industrial revolution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once a population has been fully ‘saturated’ in terms of spending and producing power (what makes up AD and AS), an economy cannot grow without either increasing the population or the capacity for the current population to generate a higher AD or AS. Since the planet only has a limited capacity for humans on it (that we have likely already surpassed) and there is yet to be another habitable planet found, it is important we discuss how to get as much economic activity out of the current population (economic agents may be seen as a limited resource here). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The first ‘solution’ this essay will discuss is to use technology to alleviate humans of menial tasks and therefore allow more human power to be diverted towards tasks that generate a higher value service/good for equivalent time investment. An example may be to replace the cashiers at supermarkets with technological substitutes (for example, the scanning system used by Amazon Fresh). This would allow those people to engage in other jobs that provide higher income and therefore increase the spending power of the population. This would lead to a rise in AD as consumption rises with an increase in disposable income. Thus, economic growth is achieved. However, the first of many issues is that just because more people are available to do a job does not necessarily translate to more jobs being available to them, if they perhaps go out of employment completely due to a lack of jobs available/skills to pursue a different career then that leaves us worse off than before as their spending power decreases without raising anyone else’s. Furthermore, even if they do get a job, their salary may not increase because of the supply of labour in that market rising, and for jobs where the salary was only marginally higher than that of a cashier, it can lead to a decrease in the person’s income as increased supply causes the wages of their new job to decrease.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second ‘solution’ is to raise the retirement age - creating a larger workforce. This leads to a higher average income as those who are currently older than the retirement age by a few years would have been earning more in their job than they receive in pension. They would also have a higher percentage of their income being disposable, as they don’t have the expenses of most middle-aged workers such as paying for children. This would increase AD, by raising consumption. However, this solution works only in theory, as again we are not actually increasing the number of jobs but only the number of workers in the economy. In this case, it is unlikely to affect the average income of those who would have retired but does stagnate the income growth of younger workers while creating a lack of jobs at the lowest levels for those looking for their first job. This would essentially have no positive impact as neither AD nor AS are particularly affected (the total income of the economic agents is the same, just distributed differently). It may lead to a decrease in AD as those who might have otherwise retired are now earning a larger income but spending less as their expenses are lower. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, this essay discussed how slowing population growth is the world’s largest economic problem due to it hindering the rise of standards of living across the world. It further discussed how technological solutions to the problem may seem attractive but due to the AD not increasing before the increase in the supply of labour, the demand for labour (derived from the demand for goods/services - AD) does not rise to meet the increased supply and thus the average income is more likely to decrease than increase.  The second solution discussed was to raise the retirement age, which had a similar issue associated with it and would be worse than the first solution as the older workers are less likely to spend all their disposable income. Further points to explore may be the political impact of both policies, and whether they would suit the electoral strategy of the opposition or the incumbent party (it is unlikely either policy is favourable in terms of attracting voters).
