          <p>
  This is a fairly short book, it’s seven chapters and about 130 pages. In that,
  however, it contains a great wealth of information and is densely packed with
  unbiased insights into key questions that form the heart of political
  philosophy. In my opinion, it fulfils the purpose it sets out: give a very
  short introduction to the world of political philosophy. It argues from both
  ends of the basic political spectrum and gives each ideology’s argument the
  respect it deserves when being discussed. For someone who is just starting to
  get into politics and is looking for guidance on how each ideology differs as
  well as the key questions that each must strive to answer, I strongly
  recommend this book.
</p>

<p>
  A feature of this book that I especially liked was that although the chapters
  were linked, it wasn’t integral to have read the previous chapter to read the
  next one; you could pick it up at any point. This makes it easy to read over a
  few weeks or even months if you are hard pressed for time. Even though I read
  it in one sitting, I know there are many people who don’t have that privilege
  and it’s one of the reasons they may be deterred from reading, but this book
  doesn’t pose that problem.
</p>

<p>
  The integral part of the book is really the content, however, and although I
  touched upon it slightly in the introduction, I have yet to go into detail and
  provide a fuller insight into the book. I’ll begin with saying that the author
  does indeed provide a very short introduction that introduces readers to key
  aspects of political philosophy without being dragged down by technical
  terminology or losing a sense of the depth of the issues being discussed. It
  discusses why we need political philosophy, key arguments for and against
  political authority, the benefits of democracy and its downfalls - and how to
  overcome these. It then discusses freedom and how to define inviolable freedom
  versus that which can be sacrificed by the state for the good of wider
  society, providing arguments from both libertarian and authoritarian points of
  view, with the reader being left to draw their own conclusions on where the
  line between personal freedom and societal freedom is. The book then goes on
  to discuss justice, and its evolution between different circumstances,
  shedding light on how there is no theory that can be defined as perfect.
</p>

<p>
  The questions asked in earlier chapters are then given further dimension by
  the last two chapters; the first concerned with how modern society may tackle
  these questions, with the rise in feminist movements and the multicultural
  nations that we live in. The second discusses justice on a larger scale: a
  global scale. It presents the arguments from cosmopolitanism camp of thought
  who believe there should only be one overarching government or that all states
  enter a permanent agreement to work together and uphold the principles of
  justice globally. The author provides arguments against these views too, but
  not in a disproportionate manner; giving the reader the capacity to draw their
  own conclusions.
</p>

<p>
  The one thing that I did find to hinder my ability to enjoy this book was the
  overly complex sentence structures; and I have been guilty of this myself in
  my writing. Although it was infrequent, I found myself losing track of the
  wider sense of the sentence. This wasn’t due to the use of obscure
  terminology, as I mentioned earlier the terminology was fairly accessible, but
  rather the use of sentences that spanned multiple lines using many connectives
  (although I see the irony in the fact that this is a multi-line sentence). My
  advice to readers would be to ensure you are in a miasma without distractions,
  allowing you to direct you focus to the book.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, I once again circle back to starting point: the book provides a clear
  and reliable introduction to political philosophy. As quoted on the back of
  the book, it is “Clearly written, widely accessible, comprehensive, and a
  reliable guide to important controversies…” (Lord Parekh).
</p>

<p>
  My next review will be of The Armchair Economist by Steven Landsburg, it
  should be out within a fortnight.
