                            This book is of a moderate length, covering topics that the public usually has a fixed opinion about, 
                            such as unemployment - which is generally considered a negative effect of a poor economy.  It then
                            explains how through economic logics alone, we can show that unemployment may not be so bad after all,
                            it could just be that rather than choosing to work (thereby impoverishing employers who have to pay 
                            them) people may choose to have fun by spending their time playing video games or at a theme park etc.
                            It sets out to challenge the concrete understanding we believe we have by analysing the costs and 
                            benefits of certain activities from an economics standpoint alone. It does all of this while maintaining
                            a dry humour throughout the book, sometimes insulting those who Landsburg believes have grossly violated
                            the economic principles.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            It is split into six sections, each covering a different topic in a few chapters. If I was to give a 
                            short summary of the book, the following paragraphs detail roughly how it would go. 

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            
                            Section one, “What life is all about”, addresses the topic of what we concern ourselves with. It suggests
                            that if we had a market for all things, we would have an extremely efficient society, and the cause of 
                            inefficiencies is not usually too many markets as many believe, but rather too few markets. It also covers 
                            the idea that we are too worried about monetary goods, and when analysing economic activity we must also
                            count those benefits to society that don’t involve money, for example happiness, and we can do this by 
                            asking the public how much they would be willing to pay to give up that benefit (essentially creating an 
                            imaginary market for it).

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Section two, “Good and evil” talks about the role that governments play in the economy (it doesn’t, but 
                            I’m short on time and don’t have a more accurate phrase). It discusses how from an economic standpoint 
                            taxes are bad, as they create deadweight loss, and how often the reasons why in a free market a judge’s 
                            decision in the courtroom may not actually change the end result of a lawsuit, just change the process 
                            by which we arrive there. 

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Section three, “How to read the news” begins with a glorious patronisation of Richard J Dennis who wrote
                            an article for the Atlantic Monthly in 1990 (I think, I couldn’t find much information on the internet). 
                            Landsburg explains the key economic principles in great detail using vocabulary understood by non-economists.
                            The rest of the section then goes on to explain how we may read something in the news or see something 
                            on social media and base our opinions only on what we directly see or read, rather than challenging it
                            and trying to form counter arguments and thereby make our own opinions, rather than taking the opinions 
                            of the journalists whose work we read. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Section four, “How markets work” explains briefly how markets work, it’s pretty self explanatory. 

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Section five, “The pitfalls of science” explains how often the scientific method may not be the best method,
                            and how getting caught up in statistical patterns can often cause you to make false assumption leading to 
                            failed policies.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Section six, “The pitfalls of religion” details an experience Landsburg had with a teacher, who transferred
                            her opinions to young impressionable children rather than giving them the information and allowing them to
                            choose. Interestingly, the views were quite left wing and I do find in my personal experience that on the 
                            internet there is a surplus of extremely vocal left wing people that seem to believe there is no right opinion
                            other than their opinion, and refuse to listen to any arguments against, thereby refusing to engage in any 
                            meaningful debate. However, it should be noted that this is not a declaration of my political views, nor does 
                            it mean that the right wing is not guilty of this too. This is largely a phenomenon of the younger population
                            tending to lean more towards the left as a generation than the older generation and therefore being more vocal
                            on the internet. 

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            In summary, the book is an insight into how economists think about day to day events and how one can reach 
                            surprising conclusions from irrefutable truths through just logic, the armchair economist. I would recommend 
                            this to anyone who is interested in the world around them and how the decisions made by those in power affect them.
