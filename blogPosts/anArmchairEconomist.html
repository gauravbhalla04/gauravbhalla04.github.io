          This book is of a moderate length, covering topics that the public
          usually has a fixed opinion about, such as unemployment - which is
          generally considered a negative effect of a poor economy. It then
          explains how through economic logics alone, we can show that
          unemployment may not be so bad after all, it could just be that rather
          than choosing to work (thereby impoverishing employers who have to pay
          them) people may choose to have fun by spending their time playing
          video games or at a theme park etc. It sets out to challenge the
          concrete understanding we believe we have by analysing the costs and
          benefits of certain activities from an economics standpoint alone. It
          does all of this while maintaining a dry humour throughout the book,
          sometimes insulting those who Landsburg believes have grossly violated
          the economic principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is split into six sections, each covering a different topic in a
          few chapters. If I was to give a short summary of the book, the
          following paragraphs detail roughly how it would go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Section one, “What life is all about”, addresses the topic of what we
          concern ourselves with. It suggests that if we had a market for all
          things, we would have an extremely efficient society, and the cause of
          inefficiencies is not usually too many markets as many believe, but
          rather too few markets. It also covers the idea that we are too
          worried about monetary goods, and when analysing economic activity we
          must also count those benefits to society that don’t involve money,
          for example happiness, and we can do this by asking the public how
          much they would be willing to pay to give up that benefit (essentially
          creating an imaginary market for it).
        </p>
        <p>
          Section two, “Good and evil” talks about the role that governments
          play in the economy (it doesn’t, but I’m short on time and don’t have
          a more accurate phrase). It discusses how from an economic standpoint
          taxes are bad, as they create deadweight loss, and how often the
          reasons why in a free market a judge’s decision in the courtroom may
          not actually change the end result of a lawsuit, just change the
          process by which we arrive there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Section three, “How to read the news” begins with a glorious
          patronisation of Richard J Dennis who wrote an article for the
          Atlantic Monthly in 1990 (I think, I couldn’t find much information on
          the internet). Landsburg explains the key economic principles in great
          detail using vocabulary understood by non-economists. The rest of the
          section then goes on to explain how we may read something in the news
          or see something on social media and base our opinions only on what we
          directly see or read, rather than challenging it and trying to form
          counter arguments and thereby make our own opinions, rather than
          taking the opinions of the journalists whose work we read.
        </p>

        <p>
          Section four, “How markets work” explains briefly how markets work,
          it’s pretty self explanatory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Section five, “The pitfalls of science” explains how often the
          scientific method may not be the best method, and how getting caught
          up in statistical patterns can often cause you to make false
          assumption leading to failed policies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Section six, “The pitfalls of religion” details an experience
          Landsburg had with a teacher, who transferred her opinions to young
          impressionable children rather than giving them the information and
          allowing them to choose. Interestingly, the views were quite left wing
          and I do find in my personal experience that on the internet there is
          a surplus of extremely vocal left wing people that seem to believe
          there is no right opinion other than their opinion, and refuse to
          listen to any arguments against, thereby refusing to engage in any
          meaningful debate. However, it should be noted that this is not a
          declaration of my political views, nor does it mean that the right
          wing is not guilty of this too. This is largely a phenomenon of the
          younger population tending to lean more towards the left as a
          generation than the older generation and therefore being more vocal on
          the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, the book is an insight into how economists think about day
          to day events and how one can reach surprising conclusions from
          irrefutable truths through just logic, the armchair economist. I would
          recommend this to anyone who is interested in the world around them
          and how the decisions made by those in power affect them.
