                            In 1998, Russia had a short burst of economic growth, fuelled by high oil prices, among other factors such as the devaluation of the 
                    currency to make their exports more competitively priced. However, as oil prices fluctuated so did Russia’s economy due to the 
                    deindustrialisation leaving it highly dependent on oil <sup>[1]</sup>. Russia is not the only country to have experienced this, countries 
                    with economies heavily dependent on the primary sector tend to have much more volatile economies - high economic growth at times and deeper 
                    recessions at others. But why is this so? Is there something else at play that just happens to correlate with the primary and service sector 
                    economies which causes these growth patterns or is it caused by the economic sectors themselves? But what even is a primary sector dependent 
                    economy? Or a service sector dependent economy? 

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        The first thing to consider is how small fluctuations in demand can affect the price of exporting raw materials, and thus the profits made
                            by companies in primary sector dependent economies. The price elasticity of demand (PED) of raw materials is very high (meaning that
                            the responsiveness of price to changes in quantity is very high - making the curve very steep) since they are necessary for producing
                            any goods in the secondary sector and therefore to fuel the tertiary sector. Commodities such as oil especially are indispensable 
                            with almost no substitutes (although with more renewable energy, this is likely to change), thus making these commodities very price 
                            inelastic. Furthermore, it isn’t easy to quickly increase production, and often there aren’t large reserves of them due to either 
                            their perishable nature or a lack of infrastructure to allow for the storage of large quantities. This leads to the supply for them
                            being very price inelastic too. Both of these are reflected in the diagram below.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="col" class="blogPicContainer">

              <br>
              <p>
              As we can see, even a small fall in demand results in a significant fall in price (P1 -> P2), but the fall in quantity is minuscule in comparison
                  (Q1 -> Q2). This means that the costs of firms in primary sector dependent economies don’t fall by much, as the cost to extract materials hasn’t
                  fallen much per unit and units only decrease slightly (C = P x Units produced). However, the revenue of these firms will have fallen significantly
                  due to the large fall in price (R = P x Units sold) and therefore so would their profits (P = R- C). Due to lower profits, the government will
                  earn less revenue through a tax on these firms. Therefore, government expenditure would have to be reduced. Furthermore, the (Export - Import)
                  part of aggregate demand (AD) would fall as export revenue falls due to plummeting prices. This is a direct blow to AD, as AD = Consumption + Investment + 
                  Government expenditure + (Exports - Imports). A country that was caught in this trap during the COVID 19 pandemic was Nigeria, in November 2020. Due 
                  to falling oil prices in 2020, and more than 80% of Nigeria’s export industry relying on oil, private investment and government revenue fell sharply, 
                  the latter dropping from 8% to 5% of GDP in a time when fiscal stimulus is desperately needed. However, due to recessions in other countries, those who
                  lived abroad and sent money home to family in Nigeria were able to send less money than usual, leading to lower consumer spending. The effects of falling
                  GDP and therefore GDP/capita were noted: there was a rise of 2.4% in poverty, meaning fewer people were able to afford necessary goods and services - such
                  as food <sup>[2]</sup>. This would exacerbate the strain on the government, as the health of those most affected by increased poverty may limit their
                  involvement in the economy in the future, hampering the recovery efforts. This means that the Nigerian government not only has less money to invest into
                  infrastructure, education and healthcare which form the foundation for economic growth, but it also needs to spend money on stimulus for the economy to 
                  limit the extent of the recession and aid recovery efforts. In summary, due to other countries being forced to reduce their demand for commodities in a 
                  recession to save money (a beggar-thy-neighbour policy), the price inelasticity of demand and supply for commodities results in a deeper, more damaging 
                  recession in primary sector dependent economies. In contrast, the supply for services tends to be more price elastic, since firms can easily provide a 
                  greater quantity at short notice due to very efficient processes and the automation of a large number of tasks. Thus, fluctuations in demand don’t affect
                  the price much.
              </p>
              <br>
              <div class="col" class="blogPicContainer">
                  <img class="blogPic" src="images/diagramtwo.png">
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>
              This means that the (X-M) component of aggregate demand for service sector dependent economies tends to be very stable, and therefore using the same chain of
                  reasoning as used previously, their recessions are much shallower and also shorter. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
              However, there are benefits to being heavily dependent on the primary sector. If we look again at the diagram but assume demand is increasing rather than
                  falling due to economic growth in other countries, we see that the effects of demand falling are once again much more significant on price than on quantity.
                  However, in this case, the price is rising and quantity only increases slightly. This means that while firms’ costs don’t rise significantly, their profits
                  do. The domino chain that occurs when beggar-thy-neighbour policies are adopted is essentially reversed, and the result is high economic growth. Therefore,
                  we can see that due to the price inelasticity of supply and demand for commodities slight fluctuations in demand can have far-reaching consequences, making
                  the economy more volatile. However, service sector dependent economies are at a disadvantage here as the elasticity of supply means even when demand rises,
                  price doesn’t rise significantly. Thus, their economic growth is slower even during times of prosperity globally. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
              Overall, however, volatility in an economy is undesirable, as it means investors will be warier to invest money in firms in that country because there is a
                  chance those firms may go out of business at very short notice during a recession. This means they are less safe investments. Therefore, even if service 
                  sector economies have slower economic growth at times, their lower volatility means they are much more attractive for investors. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
              However, what can be done to reduce volatility in economies depended on the primary sector, especially considering these tend to be less developed countries
                  that aren’t self-sustaining and reliant on exporting to other countries for economic growth. Limiting fluctuations in demand is my proposed solution, as 
                  the issue of volatility rises from small changes in demand having a large impact on the economy. This essentially means limiting the use of 
                  beggar-thy-neighbour policies, or when those policies are implemented, finding a way to supplement demand to ensure prices don’t fall too much. This can 
                  be done in two ways: banning beggar-thy-neighbour policies or by using global institutions to provide a stimulus that supplements demand and ensure prices
                  don’t crash. The former would be very difficult to implement, as it would need support from the majority of countries, which are unlikely to ban so many
                  policies that can be very effective for them in a recession. Furthermore, the policing of this would be incredibly difficult because the global institutions
                  which may be candidates to enforce this would be countries with more economic stability and therefore less affected by beggar-thy-neighbour policies, 
                  meaning they are unlikely to take action against policies that don’t harm them significantly. Thus, the latter is the more feasible one. There are two 
                  candidates: the IMF and the World Bank. Since the aim of the IMF is to maintain global economic stability, I’m going to assume that the IMF is the leading
                  candidate. The role of the IMF in a recession would essentially be to provide fiscal stimulus to countries, both those being forced to implement
                  beggar-thy-neighbour policies and also those at the receiving end. Providing stimulus to those implementing the policies leads to them being able to limit
                  the cuts to their imports, perhaps ruling out import decrease entirely. This limits the fall in demand. By providing fiscal stimulus to the countries on 
                  the receiving end, the IMF allows the government to maintain revenue and also provide subsidies to firms whose profits have gone down. Thus, that limits 
                  the contraction of aggregate demand and makes the recession less severe. However, a hurdle to providing money to the government of primary sector dependent
                  economies is that due to the correlation between primary sector dependent economies and weaker economies, and weaker economies to corruption, there is a 
                  risk the fiscal stimulus may not be correctly used. This means the IMF would have to oversee the use of fiscal stimulus by the governments.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
              In terms of concluding remarks, I would just add that many other factors affect the volatility of an economy, and I have limited my focus in this article to a
                  specific factor that interests me. Furthermore, the IMF despite its advantages is slow to react due to the procedures involved in providing fiscal stimulus,
                  and the damage may already be done by the time a fiscal stimulus is provided. Besides, there are also many primary sector dependent economies which means
                  they would have to provide large sums of money, which may not be available.
