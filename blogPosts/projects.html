  As of 28/3/2020, all my projects on this website are made in JavaScript using
  the p5js library, this is because these are the most easily shared projects
  due to their compatibility with websites.

<h3>Snake</h3>

<div class="blogPicContainer">
  <img class="blogPic" src="https://gauravbhalla.co.uk/images/snake.png" />
</div>

<p>
  This project was one of my first, and I envisioned it being similar to the
  original snake that was on the old Nokia phones. The reason I chose to make a
  snake game as one of my first projects was to allow me to practice my skills
  in JavaScript on a problem I knew the rules and restraints to. It allowed me
  to focus my attention to solving the problem without having to define the
  problem. In the end, I believe it turned out better than I had imagined, with
  smooth movement and and a dark theme to it. In terms of further development,
  I'm currently in the process of learning how to generate Hamiltonian paths to
  allow the snake to be controlled be the computer (in a way that is slightly
  cheating, but who reads the fine print anyway?). I would also like to allow
  the mobile and tablet users to control the snake using swipes on the screen,
  rather than requiring an external keyboard.
</p>

<p>
  The actual development process I'd like to believe was fairly painless,
  however, that would be a lie. I can admit that I found it fairly difficult to
  keep track of the snake's individual sections, although the rest was fairly
  easy in comparison. I used object oriented programming to make it easy to
  scale the program, and used variables declared at the start and defined fairly
  early on instead of hard coding to allow me to easily make changes. For an
  explanation as to why I chose to use object oriented programming, you can read
  the post about object
</p>
<p>
  In the development process, the first step for me was to identify the
  different challenges I would face in making the project. I broke the problem
  down into these key fundamentals:
</p>
<p>
  - movement
</p>
<p>
  - snake collision with self/walls
</p>

<p>
  - snake collision with food
</p>
<p>
  - generating positions for food and displaying the food
</p>
<p>
  - keeping track of and displaying the previous snake positions
</p>

<p>
  I then began to systematically go through the steps of solving these problems
  in order. I began with implementing the snake movement. In this I chose to use
  arrow keys on an external keyboard as it seemed to be the most feasible
  option, and I later added support for the 'wasd' keys. This was fairly easy,
  and it laid out a lot of the ground work that I would later use to solve the
  rest of the problems.
</p>
<p>
  Moving onto the second problem, I realised I could not use a snake that was
  only one block to check for collision with self, and I had to first extend the
  snake, this forced me to first solve the problem of keeping track of and
  displaying the previous snake positions. I used a dynamic array (really a list
  as it's dynamic and can hold multiple types of date but JavaScript insists
  it's an array) to store the coordinates of the snake's sections, updating them
  every time the snake moved to move them all along one value. I then iterated
  over the array to make 'boxes' at the appropriate coordinates without a border
  to give the effect of the snake being one object. I was then ready to tackle
  the next problem.
</p>
<p>
  In order check for collision, I used a builtin function that would calculate
  the distance between two points, and when the distance was one pixel or less,
  I would assume a collision had occurred and declare the snake dead, restarting
  the game. I carried this on to the collision check with the food, passing a
  set of coordinates to the function and checking if the snake's head had
  collided with the food, representing it eating the food. This would then
  trigger a function that generated a new set of random coordinates and display
  the food at the new position. The game was complete, now I just needed to add
  some colour.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, I would say this was a fairly successful project as I not only
  completed the project, I also was able to challenge myself and expand upon my
  skillset.
