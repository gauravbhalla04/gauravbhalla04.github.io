                 Question taken from here: https://www.res.org.uk/resources-page/young-economist-of-the-year-winners-announced.html
                  
                    Photo by Singkham from Pexels
                </p>
                
       
                
                <p>
                 Bringing down greenhouse emissions to net zero is not an easy task, requiring extensive regulation to encourage businesses
                 to shift away from environmentally unfriendly products and raw materials. 
                </p>
                
                
                
                <p>
                 But what exactly does “net zero” mean? It means that the volume of greenhouse gas emissions is equal to the volume removed 
                 from the atmosphere. This therefore means that your net emissions are zero, because you produce and remove the same amount. 
                    </p>

                <p>
The primary challenge is not even bringing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, because once there is a roadmap to net zero emissions it is 
straightforward, rather the challenge is to make this roadmap. There are multiple ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, I mean
there’s the obvious approach of suddenly just not having any power stations fuelled by fossil fuels, but that has far reaching consequences due
                    to the fact that over 50% of our energy is generated through fossil fuels<sup>[1]</sup>. Another approach is to increase our reliance on nuclear energy
instead, but the nuclear waste is extremely dangerous, among other issues such as the potential of a nuclear meltdown. However, for the purpose
of this essay it is assumed that “Environmental regulations” means the abandonment of fossil fuel powered energy in an instant. 
                </p>

                <p>
Furthermore, what exactly is a “drag” on economic growth? Is it as simple as just slowing down economic growth? Does it only mean short term or
long term too? If it does mean long term, then how can we reliably predict what the economic growth would’ve been like without environmental
regulations a hundred, two hundred years after the UK becomes net zero? And regardless, even if being net zero in terms of greenhouse emissions 
is a drag on economic growth, the trade-off is worth it. 
                </p>

                <p>
In addition, so far, we’ve been discussing as if the targets have actually been achieved. The targets themselves will do nothing; the effect comes 
from actually achieving those targets. However, it will be assumed in this essay that the targets are achieved.

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Therefore, if the UK wants greenhouse emissions to be net zero, the foundations of society will need to be uphauled and re-laid, a 
                    test of the British government, infrastructure and British society; this is because everything that enables modern technology, such 
                    as electricity, is linked in some way to crude oil: a fossil fuel and the use of which is the biggest hurdle to net zero emissions, 
                    and one that can only be cleared with environmental regulations. So, the question becomes: “How do environmental regulations affect
                    economic growth?” And we will discuss this based on the following assumptions mentioned earlier:
                    <dl>
                      <dd> - "Environmental regulations" means the abandonment of fossil fuel powered energy in an instant. </dd>
                      <dd> - To be a drag on economic growth means to slow it down </dd>
                      <dd> - The targets will actually be achieved </dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>
                
        
                
                <h2>
                The impact of environmental regulation on economic growth
                </h2>
                
       
                
                <p>
                    Economic growth is driven by two things: aggregate demand and aggregate supply. An increase in 
                    either of these two things leads to an increase in real GDP, and economic growth is achieved. So 
                    again, we can simplify the question into two, hopefully easier to answer, questions: “How does environmental
                    regulation impact aggregate demand?” and “How does environmental regulation impact aggregate supply?”. 
                </p>
                
          
                
                <h3> Aggregate demand and environmental regulations </h3>
        
                
                <p>
                    Aggregate demand is the total quantity of goods and services consumers are willing and able to buy at any given 
                    price point and time, therefore the total demand within an economy, and is comprised of these components:
                    <dl>
                      <dd> - Consumption  </dd>
                      <dd> - Investment </dd>
                      <dd> - Government spending </dd>
                      <dd> - The difference between exports and imports</dd>
                    </dl>
                
                    Therefore, AD = C + I + G + (X - M). The question can be broken down further into questions asking how environmental
                regulation affects each component. 
                </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
                Firstly, how would consumption be affected by environmental regulation? If governments introduce regulations then workers in
                companies providing energy via power plants fuelled by fossil fuels would be the first to lose their jobs, and this would mean 
                just under 200,000 job losses<sup>[2]</sup>. Therefore, on this front consumption would fall as these employees would be reliant
                on welfare support by the government. However, a lot of these employees will have skills transferrable to other jobs, such as those
                in managerial roles. This means a high proportion would be able to go back into employment, albeit some into jobs that pay less than 
                their job at the company. To bring this line of argument to a conclusion, the effect on consumption through those employed at energy
                companies would be negative: consumption would fall by this group, but only very slightly. This is because the average purchasing power
                of this group is likely to fall, those who are unemployed and those whose incomes fall would bring down the average and so they would
                be willing and able to buy less goods and services at any given price point, reducing consumption. However, this decrease would be rather 
                limited as the fall in incomes for those going to other jobs will not be that severe, the number who are unemployed will be low and of
                course those in roles that were higher up the hierarchy may actually see their incomes rise and therefore to an extent counteract the 
                lowering of incomes for others; I say to an extent because they are likely to have been earning more before the companies shut down and 
                more likely to save rather than spend because they are more easily satisfying their needs and wants. Looking at those whose jobs are not
                dependent upon energy companies, then their consumption is unlikely to be affected as their income won’t be affected. However, their purchasing 
                power will fall, as will be discussed later.
            </p>
            
       
            
            <p>
                The next component to discuss is investment. Investments are a tricky thing, because while money invested into the companies providing energy 
                using fossil fuels goes to nil, some of that money is redirected to other businesses, and predicting how much is redirected into British firms 
                is tough. But at least some investors will take money that was previously investing in energy companies and invest abroad, so investment will
                fall, even if it’s very little. This will have the effect of reducing aggregate demand. But, renewable energy is a very lucrative investment option
                for many investors<sup>[3]</sup> so perhaps investors will invest their money there? Perhaps, but again, it would be miraculous for 100% of the investment 
                in non-renewable energy companies to go to British renewable energy companies and so I will stick with the conclusion that investment will fall,
                even if it’s very slightly. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
                Government expenditure would rise as they would be paying out more in welfare support for those forced into unemployment. However, we have already
                taken this into account when considering consumption, as this money (and more) was previously provided by workers the amount of money in the economy
                has decreased. Therefore, to take this into account under government expenditure would be counting it twice. However, government expenditure will 
                still rise. This is because to replace non-renewable energy resources new infrastructure will be needed, and this will be funded by the government 
                either directly or via subsidies/tax relief provided to renewable energy companies. Government expenditure rises and so aggregate demand rises. 
            </p>
          
            
            <p>
                The last component, exports minus imports, falls as imports rise. This is because to fill the energy gap created by the removal of non-renewable 
                energy sources, energy will have to be bought from abroad and the infrastructure required to increase energy production using renewable resources
                will use imported parts from abroad, like perhaps the parts for windmills. Exports however would not be affected, and so the exports minus imports
                part of aggregate demand falls overall, leading to a reduction in aggregate demand.
            </p>
            

            
            <p>
                Overall, there will be a short-term reduction in aggregate demand. This means economic growth will be lower, and deflationary pressure will be exerted 
                on the economy encouraging people to save more to increase their money’s value, leading to a further reduction in aggregate demand. However, the reduction
                in aggregate demand due to this will be small, and only in the short term because once there is appropriate infrastructure in place for renewable resources
                and costs start to come down, as well as the unemployment and income reductions from companies shutting down starting to decrease as time goes on.
                Furthermore, investment will rise as new firms spring up or old ones expand to capitalise on the expanding renewable energy sector, and they raise funds
                for this, as well as investors looking to get a slice of the pie. Imports would fall again once infrastructure for renewable energy is in place, so exports
                minus imports rises and this further increases aggregate demand. Of course, once infrastructure is in place and the unemployment caused by companies shutting
                down is reduced, government expenditure falls but this will be outweighed by the other components that increase. 

            </p>
            
                
            
            <h3>Aggregate supply and environmental regulations</h3>
            
           
            
            <p>
                Aggregate supply is the quantity of goods and services firms are willing and able to supply at any given price point at any given time. To increase this, firms’ 
                costs have to go down meaning they are willing and able to sell more at any given price at any given time. And if their costs increase then aggregate supply
                decreases. So, this question becomes, “How do environmental regulations affect firms’ costs?”. A knee jerk answer would be “firms’ costs rise because renewable
                energy is more expensive”. However, we should look at real data.
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
                Firstly, as companies supplying energy via non-renewable resources close, they are now supplying exactly nil at any given price. This means that aggregate supply 
                decreases. This results in lower economic growth.
            </p>
            
       
            
            <p>
                New renewable energy technology is now cheaper than even the cheapest of coal power plants<sup>[4]</sup>. This means firms’ costs will actually go down because they’ll
                get electricity to run their offices etc for cheaper. This means that at any given price point, they are willing and able to sell more in order to make as
                much or even more profit than they were before. This means aggregate supply rises and this leads to a rise in economic growth. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, as certain companies would receive subsidies or tax relief to help the environmentally friendly reforms, their costs would go down and
                aggregate supply would rise, and with it, economic growth. In addition, new firms that spring up in this new industry sector will provide more goods
                and services at any given price and time than before they were created, so aggregate supply increases. 
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
                Overall, aggregate supply I think would rise. Firms may have a slight transitionary period, but I don’t believe it will be very long before aggregate 
                supply rises, resulting in rising economic growth. 

            </p>
            
        
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
          
            <p>
                In conclusion, I think that in the long term the shift to renewable energy will actually be beneficial to economic growth than staying with
                non-renewable resources. This is because even at current prices firms would likely save money from the shift, and if aggregate supply is rising
                then the effect of unemployment on those who worked at non-renewable energy firms would be reduced, as more labour is needed to allow firms 
                to produce this greater amount. And all of this is just considering the development stage that we are currently at with renewable energy, if
                we consider further developments and advances in the field then the costs of it would be even cheaper and so too will the benefits. Thus, in 
                the long term, targets to bring greenhouse emissions down to zero in the UK will not be a drag on economic growth and instead boost economic 
                growth, which becomes especially relevant when considering that as the world shifts to a service based economy growth will slow down and thus 
                every extra bit of growth becomes more important. 
            </p>
            
        
            
            <p>
                This poses another question, if environmental regulations would lead to better economic growth in the future then why have countries not yet
                implemented them? Well, due to trade regulations having been formed by those with corporate interests at heart, if a country introduces stricter
                regulations on health, environment, security etc then corporations have the right to file a suit for lost profits, and therefore governments 
                face a short-term cost that they may not be willing and able to bear. This prevents them from introducing such regulations, at the great expense 
                of ordinary citizens. 
            </p>
