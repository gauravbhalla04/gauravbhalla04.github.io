                It’s the 1500s and you’re out exploring the high seas in a wooden ship. You’re walking along the upper deck, and to your horror you spot a rotting plank on the side! You scramble to get it replaced, and within an hour your ship is in as glorious a condition as it was on the day it was constructed. Over time, each plank in the ship gets replaced with a new plank, the old planks thrown overboard with little care. However, unbeknownst to you, a man is following your ship and collecting each plank that you throw overboard, and once he has all the planks to make a ship, he makes a ship with the same design as your ship. The question is, which of these two is the original ship?
              </p>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                This is a famous philosophical paradox, known as the Ship of Theseus; and it’s a paradox that is in my opinion very important to consider. From it stem questions of identity, starting from “What makes the original ship, the original ship” and developing up to “What makes you, you? Are you the same person through time? What gives anything its identity?” Furthermore, we can consider partially true statements, like, “This is the original ship” when referring to your ship after a plank has been replaced, and from that stems the discussion about deciding when a statement is “true enough”. 
              </p>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Let’s assume that the ship we started with and gradually repaired is ship A, and the ship that was constructed by collecting the discarded planks is ship B.
              </p>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                However, while discussions of identity and partials truths are great, since the burning question asks which of the two ships is the original, it would be criminal to not discuss proposed answers to the question. Furthermore, to go straight to discussing identity and partial truths would be like going to a steppingstone in the middle of the river. We must first look at proposed solutions to the Ship of Theseus question as a separate steppingstone - albeit a steppingstone that may as well be as far as the ones on identity and partial truths. The first solution I will discuss is based on the four causes defined by Greek philosopher Aristotle.
              </p>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Aristotle defines four causes: the material cause, referring to what something is made of; the formal cause, referring to its defining features; the efficient cause, referring to how it was made; and the final cause, referring to its function. And if an object’s causes remain unchanged, it is the same object as before, thus its identity remains unchanged.
                
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                The material cause indisputably says that Ship B is the original ship, as Ship B is made of the exact same planks that the original ship was made of - and this is what the material cause refers to. However, if we replace one plank in a ship and it is still the original ship, then surely the new plank becomes part of the original ship and is possesses part of the ship’s “originality”. From this, we can extrapolate to argue that by the time all the planks have been replaced, we have twice the number of planks possessing “originality” than we started with and therefore both ships are the original ship. Thus, this cause clearly fails to provide a satisfactory argument as to which ship is the original, unless we’re willing to concede that Aristotle could clone dead wooden planks.
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Regarding the formal cause, well the formal cause of Ship A is the same as the singular ship we started with, so that is the original ship, even if the planks it is made of change with time. This is because its shape, size, colour and overall structure is the same - the original ship is repaired, not changed with each plank. However, this applies to Ship B too as it will by its very design have the same defining features as Ship A, so this is not a very convincing argument. And furthermore, if we take the defining features of something to be its identity, then doing things like painting an object would mean it’s a different object to before, for example: if I was to get a haircut and wish myself into growing a beard, as there is nothing but wishing on that front, then my defining features wouldn’t be the same, but my identity is unchanged. Thus, this argument falls apart. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                We can also argue that the final cause of Ship A is the same as the singular ship we started with, and Ship B’s final cause isn’t the same because the condition of the planks it is made of prevents it from perhaps even floating, regardless of whether it sails or not. This applies only to Ship A and therefore provides a clear answer to the question: Ship A is the same as the ship we started with and is arguably fairly convincing. However, we can have more than just one way to accomplish the same function. There can be two knives, both of which perform the same function and thereby arguably having the same final cause but are two completely different objects. Furthermore, if the function of a ship is to allow sea travel, then there is more than one design of object to accomplish the same function. A ship and a raft are not the same thing but have the same final cause. This is a fault caused by lack of detail, the cause is too vague to allow us to identify objects in a manner that is specific.
                
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Considering the efficient cause: the efficient cause of Ship A is that of the original ship: the planks are cut by presumably the same people using the same tools and techniques. However, we also know that the planks of Ship B are made by the same people using the same tools as the original ship. This cause therefore applies to both ships, and is little help in distinguishing between Ship A and Ship B. However, this cause too has a fundamental flaw: a person can use the same tools and techniques to make two very different objects. For example, using wooden planks, a saw, a drill, screws and a tape measure, a carpenter can use the same techniques to make both a chair and a table, yet these two are far from being the same objects. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Additionally, neither ship is able to fulfil all four causes, each fulfilling only three. So, to decide between these, are we to try and figure out which one fulfils the more important causes? How do we decide which causes are more important? Do we just accept that there are two originals? There seems to be no basis to justify doing such a thing, and so this approach doesn’t provide an answer to the question regarding the Ship of Theseus.
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                After having considered this approach, one might argue that since it fails to provide an answer to the question it has no implications on identity. However, perhaps the failure of an object’s causes to identify it suggests that identity is subjective, it isn’t an innate part of something or someone. It is not the person you’re identifying, but rather you’re identifying your thoughts about them.
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                The next approach uses American philosopher Pirsig’s “Metaphysics of Quality”. He argues that are two patterns, lower and higher order patterns which represent the parts. The lower order is what something is made of, and the higher order is the larger entity itself. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                In the ship, the lower order patterns are the planks, and the higher order pattern is the ship itself. The argument is that the lower order of the ship - the planks - change, but the higher order - the ship itself - doesn’t, thereby concluding that Ship A is the original. One could say that this is trying to say that it would be a fallacy of composition to say that since Ship B’s planks are original, the entire ship is the original ship. However, there is a key issue with this. If we take the example of an essay and try to argue that changing the lower order of the article - the words - doesn’t change the higher order, the essay itself, the idea itself seems ludicrous. I’m not sure you’d be very successful trying to convince someone that changing the words of an article doesn’t change the article itself. This is because the argument doesn’t consistently apply to different things. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                
                What does this tell us about identity? It suggests once again that identity is inconsistent, it changes over time but is still the same somehow. This seems to contradict the definition of identity as being something unique to you that stays with you for life, if it changes then has it really stayed with you throughout your life or been replaced? 
                
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Another approach is to first simplify the original question. What makes the original ship, the original ship? We can arguably say that the answer to this is the same as the answer to the question from the introduction: “What makes you, you?” We can consider further how we identify people ourselves, as humans. Consider the following situation: you are in a room, alone, with a computer in front of you with some anonymous messaging app open. You know that the person on the other side is someone you know, a friend or family member perhaps, and you have to identify who it is by conversing with them without exchanging any identifying details such as names etc. While this may seem challenging to do if the person was merely an acquaintance, if it’s someone you know well then you will likely have no trouble identifying the person within minutes. What is it that allows you to identify the person? It would be their thoughts, the way perhaps they use certain phrases or words, maybe they have certain quirks in their punctuation. Now, what leads to the development of these unique mannerisms? If we can answer that question, then we can answer the question “What makes you, you?”
              </p>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                I make case that it is your experiences, because it is by experience that humans learn. And so, you are the same person from 5 years ago but with more experience, you’ve grown as a person. It’s like you took the ship and added like an extra sail to it. Similarly, in 5 years’ time you’ll be the same person you are now, but with more experiences and you’ll have grown as a person. So, your identity remains the same, you are still you, but what that identity refers to is a more experienced person. Digressing slightly into what is identity, but I want to highlight that “identity” refers to something or someone, and that thing or person can grow, change and experience new things but their identity is fundamentally the same, and so they are still the same person they always were. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Drawing on what I said in the previous paragraph, I would argue the experiences of the ship should be used to identify which is the original ship. Therefore, we just need to answer the question: “Which ship has more of the original’s experiences?” I would argue that it’s Ship B, as the experiences of the original ship are in the planks that make Ship B. And thus, we seem to have a conclusion. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                There are of course faults in this argument too. If after one plank is replaced, Ship A is still the original ship, then are the new plank’s experiences part of the original ship’s experiences, and for the second new plank which is used and so on? If so, that would mean that the original ship’s experiences are in both the new and old planks. If not, then we don’t have an original ship while we wait for each plank to be replaced. How do we then decide which is the original ship? The ship which is made up of the planks that were in the original ship for longer? Well, if we wait long enough between replacing planks, then the planks in Ship A make up more experience otherwise the planks in Ship B have the most experience. Therefore, this theory, fails to answer the question satisfactorily in a qualitative sense, providing only a mathematical equation. However, if we knew the exact time period for which each plank was part of the original ship, then we could calculate which ship was the original, overcoming this hurdle. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                There are, however, faults in this argument too. If, after one plank is replaced, Ship A is still the original ship, then are the new plank’s experiences part of the original ship’s experiences, and so on for the second and further planks which are replaced? If so, that would mean that the original ship’s experiences are in both the sets of planks. If not, then we don’t have an original ship while we wait for each plank to be replaced. How do we then decide which is the original ship? The ship which is made up of the planks that were in the “original” ship for longer? Well, if we wait long enough between replacing planks, then the planks in Ship A make up more experience, otherwise the planks in Ship B have more experience. If we knew the exact time period for which each plank was part of the original ship, then we could calculate which ship was the original, overcoming this hurdle.  However, this theory fails to answer the question qualitatively, providing instead a mathematical equation. 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Furthermore, there is another fault: wooden planks aren’t alive to experience things. Wooden planks are inanimate objects, and so they don’t have a consciousness to experience things and give them identity. But does this mean all inanimate objects are the same? That none of them have any identity? 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                Moreover, there is another fault: wooden planks aren’t alive to experience things. They are inanimate objects, and so don’t have a consciousness to experience things and give them identity. The implications of this challenge on the concept of identity are severe: suggesting inanimate objects are all the same and have no identity. 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                The implications on identity from this approach are similar to those from Aristotle’s approach, except in one key aspect. Identity is still linked to ideas, but it is not an idea that the identifier associates with the person being identified. Instead, it is the ideas and experiences of the person being identified that are interpreted, and while everybody may interpret them in different ways, the same fundamental idea remains. This means identity is innate, and that it grows with the person. However, our cells change over time, they die and are replaced by new ones - even in the brain where you process your experiences. A potential challenge arising from this would be to consider whether or not this affects our perception of identity as being founded on the ideas of the person being identified if the cells processing experiences change. Does this mean your identity changes as you get older? Are you really the same person throughout your life if your identity has changed? 
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                However, we have not yet exhausted the arsenal of philosophical theories at our disposal. We’re essentially discussing two statements: “Ship A is the original ship” and “Ship B is the original ship”. We are trying to decide which of these is the true statement. However, rather than looking at the truthfulness of statements as a binary T/F value, we can look at it as a scale ranging from 0 - 1. For example, if I say, “It’s absolutely pouring”, it would be expected the statement has a truth value close to 1, otherwise I’m being unnecessarily whiny. However, if I say, “it’s raining”, the truth value can be lower, anywhere from a slight drizzle to an absolute onslaught of rain from above would be satisfactory.
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                
                 Now, it is important to notice that while normally we would set a threshold which the truth value must be over to determine a statement’s truth value, in this case we just have to decide which statement is truer. If we try and set thresholds, we may set them too high and end up with situations where neither is the original or set them too low and end up with two originals. Therefore, based on what we use to measure the truthfulness of the statements, we must find the value where there will be a smooth transfer of “originality” from one ship to the other.
                
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>
                
                 As an example, let’s use the proportion of original planks in the ships as our measure. For the ship to be considered the original ship it must have more original planks than the other. Therefore, we can conclude that when both ships made up half from original planks, they are “swapping originality” and the threshold where one of the two statements mentioned becomes true is 0.5. However, there is a problem with this too, what if both statements have exactly the same truth value as there is an even number of original planks and both have the same number? Then there is a problem, either neither is the original or both are!

                Furthermore, there is the same problem from the experience approach: if the new plank is in the original ship, does it gain originality? If not, why not, it’s part of the original ship. If yes, then does it have the same originality as the other planks? Why/why not? And so how would we decide which ship is the original one?

                The fundamental issue in both of these approaches is that they try to distribute “originality” to planks of the original ship, but fail to consider the states in between the original ship and Ship A, thus making every plank original or causing a dilemma where we must decide how to allocate “originality”

                In conclusion, the implications of the Ship of Theseus are that it raises doubts on the concept of identity, whether people actually have an innate identity or if it’s all a matter of subjective ideas. Further exploration of the question led to a line of thought that differs in one crucial way. It countered the original doubts about identity, highlighting instead that people do indeed have an innate identity and while we may all interpret this differently, it is still the same identity.
