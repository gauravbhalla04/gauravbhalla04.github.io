          What makes us human? What separates us from all other animals? Is there one distinct thing about humans without which you can't be considered a human?
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's discuss the proposition that being compassionate is what makes us human. Compassion for others and being able to recognise when someone is struggling and helping them out is an integral part of being human, but if someone isn't compassionate are they still human? And are humans the only species capable of compassion? 
        </p>

        <p>
          An example to discuss regarding the first question is Hitler, he certainly wasn't compassionate. While he is a human if you're considering only science, he wasn't human when considering his actions. This suggests that if someone lacks compassion, then they aren't human because of their lack of compassion. But is this exclusive to humans?
        </p>

        <p>
          No, other species have been known to be compassionate too. Elephants are compassionate towards not just each other but also other species. It'd be hard to argue that humans have shown compassion towards other species, we've been rearing animals for our consumption for thousands of years as if we're better than them and they exist to serve our purpose. Hunting is one thing, but for an animal to be born with just one purpose and that be to serve as food for another species is a very different scenario. 

        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless, humans aren't compassionate. There are plenty of murders in the human species, just like there are in other species. We are compassionate towards those who we care about, but not towards all humans. What separates our behaviour from that of other animals which do the same? 
        </p>

        <p>
          What about intelligence? Humans are by far the most intelligent species (using a system designed by humans to measure intelligence, the results of which humans concluded meant humans are the smartest) in comparison to other species, but is that what makes us human? It may be what has lead to the success of the human species, but would we be human if we weren't intelligent? While humans do indeed have a level of intelligence that far outshines other species, I don't believe that it is necessarily the most distinctive trait of humans. Primates have shown great levels of intelligence, and so have other animals, yet they aren't human. It can be argued that they haven't shown the intelligence of adult humans, however, a 5-year-old human is as human as an adult therefore that argument doesn't hold. 

        </p>

        <p>
          If intelligence and compassion don't make us human, then what does? Perhaps the ability to think about abstract things, or hypothetical situations (I appreciate this is arguably a subset of intelligence, however, I think intelligence in the real world - use of tools etc is different to the intelligence discussed in this paragraph). Humans can think about situations that haven't happened yet, and plan for them. For example, a monkey can alert other monkeys if they see a threat, but they can't think 'if I see a threat, I will do this' and plan. Humans, however, can. Furthermore, we have concepts of religion, or emotions etc, which are abstract concepts that other animals can't grasp but humans can. If we couldn't discuss such things, then I think we lose what makes us human. To be aware of abstract concepts, the topic of this article is itself an abstract concept, is what makes us human. Essentially, the ability to ask 'what makes us human' is exactly what makes us human.
